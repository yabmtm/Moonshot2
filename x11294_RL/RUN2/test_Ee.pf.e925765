GROMACS:      mdrun_mpi, version 2018.8
Executable:   /gpfs/opt/apps/gromacs-2018.8/bin/mdrun_mpi
Data prefix:  /gpfs/opt/apps/gromacs-2018.8
Working dir:  /work/tug27224/MOON2/projects/x11294_RL/RUN2
Command line:
  mdrun_mpi -maxh 47 -s prod.tpr

Compiled SIMD: SSE4.1, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
mdrun_mpi was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding mdrun_mpi with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file prod.tpr, VERSION 2018.8 (single precision)

Multiple energy groups is not implemented for GPUs, falling back to the CPU. For better performance, run on the GPU without energy groups and then do gmx mdrun -rerun option on the trajectory with an energy group .tpr file.

Will use 18 particle-particle and 10 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file

Using 28 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity

NOTE: There are issues with expanded ensemble and certain combination of nstexpanded and nstcalcenergy, setting nstcalcenergy to 1

Program:     mdrun_mpi, version 2018.8
Source file: src/gromacs/ewald/pme-redistribute.cpp (line 282)
MPI rank:    10 (out of 28)

Fatal error:
3 particles communicated to PME rank 3 are more than 2/3 times the cut-off out
of the domain decomposition cell of their charge group in dimension x.
This usually means that your system is not well equilibrated.

website at http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Errors
-------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Listed nonbonded interaction between particles 1671 and 1673
at distance 2.198 which is larger than the table limit 2.005 nm.

This is likely either a 1,4 interaction, or a listed interaction inside
a smaller molecule you are decoupling during a free energy calculation.
Since interactions at distances beyond the table cannot be computed,
they are skipped until they are inside the table limit again. You will
only see this message once, even if it occurs for several interactions.

IMPORTANT: This should not happen in a stable simulation, so there is
probably something wrong with your system. Only change the table-extension
distance in the mdp file if you are really sure that is the reason.
